# Deep-Learning-on-Amazon-Alexa-Reviews
This notebook will show you how to implement a deep leaning algorithm (LSTM) on the Amazon Alexa Reviews dataset
This notebook explains how to implement a deep learning model on amazon Alexa reviews dataset that is available on Kaggle. 
The deep learning model used in this video is LSTM. If you want to know how to implement different machine learning classifiers 
such as Logistic Regression or Multinominal Naïve Bayes on this dataset, or if you want to know how to implement deep learning classifiers
such as artificial neural networks on this dataset, I’ve done a separate notebook on these topics as well.
